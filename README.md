# CSSColourNames

https://daryllpenafiel.github.io/CSSColourNames/

It's a simple html page that shows all default HTML named colours.
I often use it as a reference when working on my projects.
Originally, it took me 500+ lines of html and css code to finish the page.

I'm proud to say that the current version was completed dynamically with under 100 lines of code.
